A “tenor” can be defined as unit of frequency or duration for certain financial products.  Tenors can also be seen as time buckets.  Sorting tenors adequately is a necessary task when producing financial reports.
In this coding exercise we will use the following format:
1d = 1 day
2d = 2 days
1w = 1 week
1m = 1 month
1y = 1 year
1d1w = 1 day and 1 week
1y1d1m = 1 year, 1 day and 1 month
… etc
You have been provided a flat file containing data called data.txt.  The data in this file is comma separated and contains three columns: “Tenor”, “PortfolioID” and “Value”.  “PortfolioID” is of type string and “Value” of type double.
Given the above please:
1)	Create a C# console project.
2)	Write logic to load and parse the data of the file. (Do not display invalid data)
3)	Output the data sorted by Tenor and PortfolioID.
4)	Output the data sorted by PortfolioID and Tenor.
5)	Write the results from question 3 and 4 to flat files called 3.txt and 4.txt.
6)	Please complete the items above and submit your project compressed in a zip file.  Make sure your zip file doesn’t contain any binaries (dll, exe, etc)
7)	Make sure your code is well structured, simple, testable and runnable.
8)	Please list your assumptions with reasons.
